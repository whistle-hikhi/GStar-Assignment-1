## Problem 1: PyTorch Foundation

### **Approach**

Problem 1 establishes the mathematical and algorithmic foundation by implementing Flash Attention in pure PyTorch. This serves as the reference implementation and ground truth for all subsequent optimizations.

**Key Implementation Details:**

1. **Tiled Processing**: Implemented query and key/value tiling with configurable tile sizes (128x128)
2. **Online Softmax Algorithm**: Core innovation that enables memory efficiency
   - Maintains running maximum (`m_i`) and normalization factor (`l_i`)
   - Updates accumulators incrementally without storing full attention matrix
3. **Numerical Stability**: Used float32 for internal computations to prevent overflow/underflow
4. **Causal Masking**: Applied causal constraints by masking future positions with `-inf`

**Mathematical Foundation:**
```python
# Online softmax update equations:
m_new = max(m_i, max(S_ij))  # Running maximum
rescale = exp(m_i - m_new)   # Rescaling factor
o_i = o_i * rescale + exp(S_ij - m_new) @ V_j  # Output accumulation
l_i = l_i * rescale + sum(exp(S_ij - m_new))   # Normalization factor
```

### **Key Learnings**

1. **Memory Efficiency**: Traditional attention requires O(N²) memory for the attention matrix, while Flash Attention reduces this to O(N) through tiling and online computation
2. **Mathematical Exactness**: Despite the tiled approach, the algorithm produces mathematically identical results to standard attention through careful online softmax updates
3. **Numerical Considerations**: The choice of data types and handling of infinity values is crucial for stability
4. **Algorithmic Complexity**: Understanding that the same computation can be reorganized for dramatically different memory characteristics

**Performance Insights:**
- Memory usage scales linearly with sequence length instead of quadratically
- Computational complexity remains O(N²) but with better cache locality
- Trade-off between tile size and memory usage vs. computational efficiency

## Problem 4: Causal Flash Attention

### **Approach**

Problem 4 extends the non-causal kernel to support causal masking, which is essential for autoregressive language models. This introduces the complexity of handling irregular computation patterns efficiently.

3. **Load Balancing**:
   - Different thread blocks have varying amounts of work
   - Optimized for the common case while handling edge cases

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
# Phase 1: Process all off-diagonal blocks (no masking needed)
for start_n in range(0, q_block_idx * BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N):
    # Full attention computation
    
# Phase 2: Process diagonal blocks with causal masking
for start_n in range(diag_start, (q_block_idx + 1) * BLOCK_M, BLOCK_N):
    causal_mask = (k_offsets <= q_offsets[:, None])
    S = tl.where(causal_mask, S, -1e9)
```

## Problem 5: Grouped Query Attention (GQA)

### **Approach**

Problem 5 implements Grouped Query Attention, a critical memory optimization technique used in modern large language models like Llama, Mistral, and GPT-4. GQA reduces memory usage by sharing key-value pairs across multiple query heads.

**Core GQA Concept:**

1. **Head Grouping Strategy**:
   - Multiple query heads share the same key-value head
   - Contiguous grouping: `kv_head_idx = q_head_idx // (n_q_heads // n_kv_heads)`
   - Maintains attention quality while reducing memory

2. **Memory Layout Optimization**:
   - Separate strides for Q vs K/V tensors
   - Efficient mapping from query heads to shared KV heads
   - Minimal computational overhead for head mapping

3. **Kernel Modifications**:
   - Extended grid launch to handle different head counts
   - Modified pointer arithmetic for KV head sharing
   - Maintained compatibility with standard attention

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# GQA head mapping
q_per_kv = N_Q_HEADS // N_KV_HEADS
kv_head_idx = q_head_idx // q_per_kv

# Use different head indices for Q vs KV
q_ptrs = Q_ptr + batch_idx * q_stride_b + q_head_idx * q_stride_h + ...
k_ptrs = K_ptr + batch_idx * k_stride_b + kv_head_idx * k_stride_h + ...
```

## Problem 6: Sliding Window Attention

### **Approach**

Problem 6 implements Sliding Window Attention, which limits each token's attention to a fixed-size local window. This enables processing of arbitrarily long sequences with bounded memory usage.

**Sliding Window Concept:**

1. **Local Attention Pattern**:
   - Each query attends to keys within a fixed window
   - Window size typically 256-2048 tokens
   - Maintains local context while reducing computation

2. **Masking Strategy**:
   - Combined causal and window masking
   - Efficient mask computation: `k_pos >= q_pos - (window_size - 1)`
   - Preserved numerical stability with masked attention scores

3. **Memory Benefits**:
   - Attention computation becomes O(N * W) instead of O(N²)
   - Enables processing of very long sequences
   - Maintains reasonable computational complexity

**Implementation Pattern:**
```python
# Sliding window mask computation
sliding_mask = (k_offsets >= q_offsets - (WINDOW_SIZE - 1)) & \
               (k_offsets <= q_offsets)  # Combined with causal
combined_mask = sliding_mask & sequence_mask
s_ij = tl.where(combined_mask, s_ij, -1e9)
```

## Problem 7: Attention Sinks

### **Approach**

Problem 7 adds Attention Sinks to Sliding Window Attention, addressing a critical limitation where initial tokens lose their global influence. Attention sinks preserve access to a few initial "sink" tokens regardless of window position.

**Attention Sinks Concept:**

1. **Dual Attention Pattern**:
   - Local sliding window for recent context
   - Global access to initial sink tokens
   - Combined pattern: `(sliding_window | sink_tokens) & causal`

2. **Sink Token Strategy**:
   - First few tokens (typically 4-16) remain globally accessible
   - Preserves important context like system prompts
   - Maintains model stability for long sequences

3. **Mask Combination**:
   - Efficient boolean logic for combined masking
   - Minimal computational overhead
   - Preserved attention quality

**Implementation Details:**
```python
# Combined sliding window + attention sink masking
sliding_mask = (k_offsets <= q_offsets) & \
               (k_offsets >= q_offsets - (WINDOW_SIZE - 1))
sink_mask = (k_offsets < SINK_SIZE) & (k_offsets <= q_offsets)
combined_mask = sliding_mask | sink_mask
```
